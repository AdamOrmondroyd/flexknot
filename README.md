# Flex-Knot

This repo contains flex-knots and associated likelihoods used in my `toy\_sine` project, and likelihoods associated with them.

If I get this right, I should be able to use this to investigate $w(z)$ and so on.

To pip install:

    pip install git+https://github.com/Ormorod/flexknot@main
