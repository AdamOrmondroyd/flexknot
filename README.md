# linf (Linear INterpolation Function)

This repo contains linfs and associated likelihoods used in my toy_sine project, and likelihoods associated with them.

If I get this right, I should be able to use this to investigate w(z) and so on.

To pip install:

    pip install git+https://github.com/Ormorod/linf@main
